      "content": "As a Vancouver-based Senior Software Engineer, I bring over a decade of experience architecting and building complex SaaS platforms. My expertise lies at the intersection of Ruby on Rails and React, but my focus is always on the business outcome.\n\nI'm not just a developer; I'm a technical partner who bridges the gap between product, engineering, and business goals. At Samsung, I owned the redesign of core, revenue-driving campaign workflows, boosting adoption and reducing support tickets. At Instacart, I didn't just integrate APIsâ€”I built GPT-4-powered tools that slashed partner onboarding times from weeks to days.\n\nWith professional experience in both Tokyo and Canada, I thrive in international, fast-paced environments. I'm fluent in English and conversational in Japanese, allowing me to collaborate effectively with global teams. My passion is mentoring and delivering secure, event-driven architectures that truly scale."
